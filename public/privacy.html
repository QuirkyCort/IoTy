  <title>IoTy Privacy Policy</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
        This is the privacy policy of the IoTy website hosted at https://ioty.a9i.sg.
        As IoTy is a free and opensource software, you may find it hosted on other sites as well.
        This privacy policy does not apply to these other sites, as we have little to no control over them.
    </p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>

    <p>
        If you give a browser a cookie, what do you think will happen next?
        We don't know, as we don't use any cookies.
    </p>

    <h2>Server Logs</h2>

    <p>
        Like any web servers, the web server for IoTy keeps a log of every request and error.
        Standard stuff.
    </p>

    <p>The log will contains information about...</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Which page is being requested</li>
        <li>Time and date of request</li>
        <li>IP address of the requestor, which in turn provides a rough location where the IP address is located</li>
        <li>User agent sent by your browser, which typically contains the browser and operating system name</li>
        <li>Referrer page (...if your browser and the referrer page is configured to send this)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        We use this log to monitor the amount of traffic on our server and fix errors.
        We do not use this data to show you content based on a location, so everyone sees the same content regardless of where you are.
        We do not sell this information and doubt anyone would want to buy it.
    </p>

    <p>The server log is purged regularly to save space.</p>

    <h2>Third Party Websites</h2>

    <p>
        The IoTy website links to some third party websites.
        They may or may not collect your personal information; we don't really know, those sites don't belong to us.
        Read their privacy policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Personal Data</h2>

    <p>If you wish to remove your personal data from our system, please follow these instructions:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Do nothing</li>
        <li>You're done</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        We don't collect, keep, or want any of your personal data.
        Don't send them to us.
    </p>

    <h2>Local Storage</h2>

    <p>
        IoTy automatically stores your code (Blocks or Python) and network settings on your browser.
        These data does not leave your browser and are not transmitted to us or across the internet (...unless you extracted it out and email it or something like that).
        We do not have access to your code or network settings.
    </p>

    <h2>MQTT Broker</h2>

    <p>
        IoTy can optionally use MQTT in three ways:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Programming of your IoTy device via MQTT (Internet mode)</li>
        <li>Storage of your app in the MQTT App Builder</li>
        <li>Communication between your app and the IoTy device</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        By default, IoTy is set to use the MQTT broker at mqtt.a9i.sg.
        If you use this broker, your app will be stored on our server, and any data sent via MQTT will pass through and may be stored on the server.
        If you use your own MQTT broker, your app / code / data will not be sent to our server.
        You can also choose not to use MQTT at all.
    </p>

    <h2>Emails</h2>

    <p>
        If you email us, we may reply to you.
        If you include your name in your email, we'll know your name.
        Don't email us asking for help with lost code, class assignment, solution to challenges; we can't or won't help with those.
    </p>
